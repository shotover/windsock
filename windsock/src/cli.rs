const ABOUT: &str = r#"Bench Names:
    Each benchmark has a unique name, this name is used by many options listed below.
    The name is derived from an alphabetical sorting of its tags so you wont find it directly in the bench
    implementation but it will be listed in the `list` command.

Tag Filters:
    Many options below take tag filters that specify which benches to include.
    Tag filters specify which benches to include and the filter results are unioned.

    So:
    * The filter "foo=some_value" will include only benches with the tag key `foo` and the tag value `some_value`
    * The filter "foo=some_value bar=another_value" will include only benches that match "foo=some_value" and "bar=another_value"
    * The filter "" will include all benches

    A filters tags can also be separated by commas allowing names to function as filters.
    So: foo=some_value,bar=another_value is a name but it can also be used where a filter is accepted."#;
